An initial `org.apache.accumulo.trace.instrument.receivers.SpanReceiver` implementation for writing to a [Zipkin](http://twitter.github.io/zipkin/) Collector. This work supports [ACCUMULO-898](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-898). This code reused a lot of the work done recently in [HTrace](https://github.com/cloudera/htrace) to support a ZipkinSpanReceiver in that API so thanks to the HTrace developers for the reference.
